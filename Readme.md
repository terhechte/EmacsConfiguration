I really like Vim, I do have some problems sometimes with various small tidbits. For one, I don't like VimScript, also I've never found a really good way of editing html / javascript / css documents. Somehow the indendation never quite works as I expect. Finally, I've been doing more Scala lately and I wanted to play around with Clojure and both these languages have far stronger Emacs support.

With Evil, there's a really fantastic Emacs library that emulates Vim impressingly well. Even better, the way it is written in Emacs Lisp, it allows for very easy customization.
So this is my first attempt of switching from Vim to Emacs *for certain tasks*. Every tool for its job, so I'll continue to use Vim for python and shell scripts and probably Objective-C (the Emacs Clang libraries I've found so far really don't shine when it comes to Objective-C support. Well, it is kinda a sad state for Vim, too, just not as sad as on Emacs. I guess most people simply decide to use XCode and are done with it). Emacs then for Scala, Clojure, other Lisps, Javascript/Html, and maybe more. Lets see.

This repository is the result of me toying around with Emacs and trying to understand it.
